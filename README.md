## Getting started

If you use the same environment I need, you need first to have IntelliJ IDEA (at least Community) and Cursive plugin (free for non-commercial use, but need to request for a free licence after initial trial period).

Then:

1. Clone repo
2. Install ASDF: https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html
3. Install deps: `asdf install`
2. Run repl `clj -M:repl:nrepl`
